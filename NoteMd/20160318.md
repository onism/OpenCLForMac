Creating an OpenCL program requires writting codes for the host side, as well as for the device side.

# kernel Code
Declaring a function to be executed on the kernel

```
 __kernel void hello(__global char * string)
```

 The "__kernel" speicifies the function to be executed on the device. It must be called by the host, which is done by using one of the following OpenCL runtime API commands

 1. Task Call: clEnqueueTask()
 2. Data-parallel Call: clEnqueueNDRangeKernel


 Since the kernel is not of a data-parallel nature, the clEnqueueTask is called from the host to process the kernel.

 The kernel is only allowed read/write access to global, constant, and private memoryï¼Œwhich is specified  by __global,__constant,__local,__private,respectively.

 ## Host Code

The host program tells the device to execute the kernel using the OpenCL runtime API.

1. Get a list of  available platforms
2. select device
3. Create Context
4. Create Command queue
5. Create memory objects
6. Read kernel file
7. Create program object
8. Compile kernel
9. Create kernel objects
10. set kernel arguments
11. execute kernel
12. Read memory object
13. free objects
